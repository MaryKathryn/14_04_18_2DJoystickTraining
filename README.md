# 2D-joystickTraining

Progression of tasks for joystick training in 2D for monkeyLogic - April 2018

Start with 1/2 the screen as target so they learn how to push the joystick left and right.
Make the target slightly smaller and at each of the 4 corners so they learn how to move up and down as well as left and right. 
Continue decreasing the size of the target so they improve their steering skills.
